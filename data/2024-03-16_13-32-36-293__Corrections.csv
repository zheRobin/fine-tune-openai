"""As a small-business owner, I really enjoyed this book\u2026 especially how practical it is. So, why 4 stars instead of 5? Well, there are a few sales tips that Hormozi SAYS are ethical and moral, but that are actually kind of sketchy. But that said, it did contain a lot of practical advice.""",low_value
"""Disclaimer: I HAVE NOT read any of this book yet. This review is soley based on my first impression of the print (which is not good).For the record, I enjoy the hell out of Alex's content. Based on the quality of said content, I'm willing to suspend any negative sentiment toward him and his team. I'm also fairly confident that the actual written content of this book is phenomenal. As a testament to this, I willingly chose to forego the cheaper digital/audible editions, opting instead to invest in this full-price printed copy.That being said, this is absolutely the most subpar print quality I have ever encountered in any book. The images appear to have undergone severe compression, presumably in an attempt to conserve ink. The attached table forces me to strain my eyes, overshadowing its intended impact as a meaningful example. The photo of the hand-written note is rendered practically illegible due to poor lighting, leaving me to wonder if there was truly no feasible way to enhance its clarity even slightly. The presentation falls egregiously short of the excellence expected from such a remarkable content creator and businessman.What else can I say? I'm honestly dissapointed. I waited so eagerly for this book (3 weeks overseas), only to find it was delivered without enough care to even fully render the example images.But hey, congratulations. You made the sale.""",low_value
