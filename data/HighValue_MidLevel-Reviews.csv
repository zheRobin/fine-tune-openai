"I am so disappointed in this suit. I bought the pink/purple one for my granddaughter, purple is her favorite color. She wore it one time swimming and all the purple was gone! Now she has a pink faded suit that looks old after one vacation. I bought my other granddaughters their favorite color suits as well. I imagine they will get one good swim out of theirs before they look old and faded as well. Very disappointed. A lot of money for one vacation!","This is adorable! Fits great and looks super cute on my daughter, but we laid it on a towel to fry one day and the pink color bled on the towel. It also faded some after a few washes. Definitely good value for the money, but be careful what you lay it on when it’s wet.","Love the style and fit (once we got the right size; it runs small), but the color bleeds even after washing. I let the wet bathing suit sit for a day in the laundry room with some beach towels, and when I went to put them in the wash, there was pink all over the place. First time this has ever happened with a bathing suit.","Can only comment on sizing, which should be useful for some people. I have a 42-inch waist, so based on comments from a couple of other users, I decided to order the 2X (not 2XL). The waist is probably the ideal size. Two things that make me less happy: the inner liner, as usual in larger swim shorts, has not been made large enough to suit the obviously larger body of a man who is ordering this kind of huge swimwear. It is almost comical to contemplate the lack of sense that clothing manufacturers demonstrate these days. They put a small liner in a huge pair of trunks, so that the liner functions as a do-it-yourself home castrate kit, or enema kit. Also, related to sizing, if you are ordering these larger sizes, the trunks are going to come down to your knees at least, rather than to a reasonable level like you see in the photos. I haven't went on vacation yet, so I don't know how they will perform in the water.","I get it. Everyone is buying these now after years of not caring about Stanley tumblers because of social media. The problem with viral crap like this is we get caught up in fitting in and jumping on the band wagon that we fail to see what's wrong with a product before buying it. THIS TUMBLER IS NOT LEAK PROOF. It's not even a little resistent to leaking. Even if you have the top fully closed and the straw taken out, the liquid inside will leak out like crazy if you tip it over even slightly. To me, if I'm going to carry around 30-40oz of hot or cold liquids then the tumbler MUST prevent said liquids from coming out. I understand it's not a water bottle, but that's a lame technicality that Stanley shouldn't cling to. At a MINIMUM the tumbler should be leak proof if I take out the straw and close the top. Furthermore, the sip top closing mechanism seems very flimsy and can be easily bended out of place, so beware of turning it too hard or especially dropping your tumbler. I am highly disappointed for being sucked into thinking this was a reliable tumbler that would replace others I have. Granted they are not as nice looking, but they do the job of holding AND containing the water I take with me all day to and from work in NYC. I do NOT recommend this tumbler and I would suggest that Stanley fix these important issues instead of focusing on more colors and patterns.","I did not want to buy a Stanley Cup because of the hype. Once I read reviews and on how long it keeps water, cool, I decided to buy one for me and my husband. He has the black one and I have the one in fog in the picture, these tumblers do keep your water cold for long periods of time. I still had ice in mine from the night before, which is impressive. They are a bit heavier, but I don’t mind that I’ve already dropped it, and it left a little bit of a scratch, but no dents. Overall a great quality Tumblr. The only issue I have is that it is not leak proof . My Hydro flask tumblers are leak proof, but they don’t keep things as cool as the Stanley cups. I also got the 40 ounce ones for both of us, I drink a lot of water, and this helps me stay hydrated.","I had to replace my old thermometer and that one is no longer available. This one is shaped like it and looks almost the same so thought it would be the same. Not really. The readings take a little longer than I would like. It's definitely not instant. The only time it feels instant is when something is way over the desired temp already. If something is below 150 degrees Fahrenheit then it does a slow crawl up to the temperature that the item is. If something is over 150 degrees, then it reads quickly. Kind of annoying when I'm trying to make burgers or steak a medium rare or keep chicken from being overcooked and want to hit exactly 165. I accidentally threw away the box before testing it so I can't return it anymore so I'll just deal with the slow readings for now until I feel like spending money again.",Was looking for something that would work for the limited time I needed to use headphones to listen to my records. They are pretty comfortable to be honest. The sound is on par with a Bluetooth over the head cans I had that. Actaully prob better than those. Get a good amount of base and the sound isn’t flat. Got these and tested out for a few hours. The bag it comes with is pretty nice to keep them in plus my 15 foot extension I need to sit in my chair. Pretty happy with my purchase,"I enjoy everything about these headphones. Money well spent, worth the price. The flexibility, sound and color are nice, and the cord for wire use is NOT flimsy. They are comfortable and my ear ls don't sweat. Personally there were two issues I found... 1. The adjustment for the length falls short, wearing a hat with the headphones is a bit difficult because they are a bit too short. 2. The instructions on how to turn on the Bluetooth does not indicate that you must press and hold button until the lights flash to turn on. I am a first time user of Bluetooth headphones so it took me awhile and some experimenting to figure it out. Thank you!","Be aware that most of this book is the authors recounting their SEAL operations in Iraq. At the end of each chapter they have a leadership lesson and an example of it in a business setting. Most of the leadership lessons you have heard before but at least they present them in a clear manner. After a few chapters I was skipping the war stories and just going to the end part of each chapter. Of course it avoids the obvious lesson which is to consider if what you are doing is moral or ethical in the first place; I get it they were hardly in a position to question that. Business is not war; the objectives, moral and ethical environment, options available to the participants and consequences of their actions are completely different (though sometimes it can still result in people getting killed). I'm sure they do good business so that their clients who have not been in the military get to feel be cool and macho by association, but there are lots of bad leaders out there I'm sure they help."
