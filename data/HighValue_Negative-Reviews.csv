"Wow is this book a tremendous waste of your time. Clocking in at a mere 260 pages (appendices included), the author still finds the space to waste pages and pages and whole chapters of your time for endless repetition of simple concepts, painfully relentless hand-holding- as if you were a nervous wreck, to timid to do something as bold as visualizing your goals- notes on the structure of the book for some reason, like you are his editor, and personal anecdotes that never seem to end and demonstrate concepts that were obvious in the first place. All to open your eyes to breakthrough ideas like ""setting goals helps you get things done"". This entire book, distilled down to the content it claims to be focused on, should have been a 2,000 word article. This is regardless of the fact the author sucks at writing convincingly. His points are well taken, mostly because they're so broad and vague they should be in fortune cookies, but his means of arriving to them can be summarized as ""statement of something already quite obvious -> personal anecdote of how this helped someone with something at some point in their lives -> therefore comfort peace and freedom"". Its nonsense.","I was really hoping for a science-backed, progressive book about psychology and money, and I was disappointed. The description of the book is posed to be about the real-life individual and the psychology behind their financial decisions. But there is very little content about actual average people and how they relate to their money. It mostly consists of case studies of billionaires, investors, and CEOs from 1900s-2009. The conversation also largely excludes women as financial decision makers. The author makes a lot of presumptions that his audience are males with stereotypically ""male"" interests like cars and watches. There are also references to studies done with only males as the subjects without any acknowledgement of this. (And the whole “all little boys want to grow up to drive tractors"" bit seems very outdated and dismissive towards urban and suburban communities.) I understand men are overrepresented in finance today, but the book also gives a lot of stage time to doctors, writers, psychologists, inventors, performers, and scientists. There are only 4 women in the whole book that are quoted in a way that gives respect to their intelligence and power: A glaciologist, an author/financial journalist, a professor, and Eleanor Roosevelt. (For reference, there seems to be about 2 men quoted on every page; there are 200+ pages.) The rest of the women mentioned (usually not directly quoted) are characterized by the lack of power or intelligence they have, or are fictional characters: A former prostitute turned sweat shop worker who is grateful to be exploited by a lesser evil; A famous singer the author publicly shames for being bad with money, and he encourages us to laugh at her; A made-up character named Sue (who is smart); A centenarian who naively believed that WWI ending would bring world peace; and a series of worried 1920s wives of investors, widows, and daughters, all dependent on men. I don’t think it was the authors intention to make the book so exclusive, but for a book supposedly about PSYCHOLOGY this is a glaring error. I am not discrediting the finance advice give in the book in any way, although the message is nothing new nor progressive. But this is not a psychology book; it makes a lot of narrow presumptions about the reader’s beliefs, life experiences, and interests, it omits underrepresented groups of people, and for those reasons I was disappointed.","Contained within are some useful tips and insights for those who are naive about finance. However, these could (and should) have been condensed into a newpaper or magazine article. It's hard to imagine anyone who needs such elementary guidance being allured by a book with ""psychology"" in its title. In any event, the title is an abuse of the word. The descriptions of occasionally observed behaviours are no more ""psychology"" than the line of ""Life's for living - yeah! - that's our philosophy"" is philosophy. These useful tips and insights are padded out to book length with platitudes and excessive self-reference from the author. I'm tempted towards 1*, but there is at least some value in the tips and insights given.","I want to love these shorts, I really like the patterns, the fit, and the quick drying of the material, but there is one major issue for me. They have cargo pockets. First off let’s get this out of the way, why in the world does anyone need cargo pockets in a swimsuit? You’re getting in the water designers, get over it. Second it’s the cargo pockets. They hold water. Yes there is a drain on the inside of the suit, but it’s higher than the bottom of the pocket, and they still hold water. The amazing quick dry fabric allows you to quickly dry off the shorts but for the next few minutes water is still dripping down your legs. It’s really a disappointment. Especially if your walking in the house. Haven’t decided if I’m sending them back or not, but not having the cargo pockets I’d order even more of them.","My ""tweenage"" daughter recently used some of her Christmas money to buy a large Stanley tumbler. The tumbler arrived promptly and was all she was hoping for, but shortly after receiving her cup we heard reports that Stanley cups contain led. I thought this must be a malicious rumor, but since led is highly toxic, I ordered a test kit to double check her cup. We used a swab kit purchased through Amazon and checked the inside of the cup. Much to our dismay, the test clearly showed led on the inside of the cup. We were completely shocked! Now it is too late for us to send the cup back through Amazon, but we cannot use the cup. I have tried to warn friends and family to check, but most don't believe me or seem to care, which is very surprising. I'm putting a general warning out to all who may have purchased a Stanley tumbler, please led test your cup before using. This is no longer just a rumor, but is being reported by major news stations as well. Also, Amazon should allow buyers to return their contaminated products past the normal return dates since this is a serious health hazard.","My husband purchased this “Stanley” cup for me for Christmas thinking it was the real deal. It is not. I purchased one for him elsewhere and there are stark differences. The cup I received from Amazon came with paint in random spots and a ding. I looked passed it, because I was excited. Then I noticed the handle is not in the correct position on the cup, it is an inch below the silver. The screws are also not the correct ones. They are philips head style. Lastly the lid. The lid is made of cheap plastic. It broke within a couple weeks of use. It was impossible to remove, I had to ask my husband to do it any time I wanted water. The little piece that the straw goes through doesn’t even fit, it pops up all the time. As you can imagine. I am not happy with this product.","The temperature keeps jumping around and never settles on a reading. Back and forth it will fluctuate within a degree or two. So I read the directions on how to calibrate the unit. The temperature was jumping around and could never settle on any degree the entire time which made it difficult. Even just sitting at room temperature, it would keep fluctuating until it turned off. Tried to calibrate it and it kept jumping back and forth rapidly .2 degrees, then 2, 4, 9 degrees that it was nearly impossible to adjust. Finally got it to the right temperature. Or so I thought. It started fluctuating immediately. Decided to test it with boiling water thinking perhaps the ice water was melting. Got strange temperature readings like -0.6F, 148.3F, and finally 207.5F. This was even with the burner turned off and water still boiling. The steam from the water got water inside the screen immediately. It is NOT waterproof like they claim. Tried to read temperatures on other items. Nothing was accurate and my cheap 5 dollar thermometer I was using side by side was spot on. It started to put out an Err code. After trying multiple times to recalibrate and read various temperatures, gave up and boxed it up. Will be returning and going back to Thermapro. They give accurate readings. Only got this one as it was listed as waterproof and on sale. Never got a 3-4 second reading, nothing that was even close to accurate, not water proof and the magnet isn't strong enough to even stick to the side of the fridge. Pretty much worthless.","I purchased this thermometer a couple years back and it worked great at first and was everything I was looking for in a thermometer out on the grill. The past 6 months or so it has been acting up. First, it would just turn itself off while taking a reading or would be difficult to turn on (a minor nuisance). Then, the screen started flashing on/off rapidly when trying to use it and would eventually work after pulling the battery and re-inserting a couple of times (a bigger nuisance). Now, the thing almost never works - it's hard to turn on and often won't stay on long enough to use. I have obviously replaced the battery with a fresh one on more than one occasion but this is not the problem because the behavior remains the same. It appears that something is wrong with the unit internally. I emailed customer service and received a reply from Sarah within hours apologizing for the problem and asking to verify my home address for a replacement unit. I did that and thought GREAT...this is awesome!...WRONG. It's been 3 months and nothing. I've sent 2 follow-up emails asking the status, all to go ignored. I don't write negative reviews but I also can't stand liars and false advertising. So, buy at your own risk because if you have a problem, you might not get this company to honor their warranty. Too bad...","I bought this book based on many raving reviews by people I know. Although I see the merit for people that struggle in leadership positions, or people wanting to build better cultures within organizations, most of the principles were basic and what I would consider common knowledge. There were some cool SEAL stories mixed in, but it felt like they were saying the same things over and over again , making it excruciating to finish the entire book.","It seems I'm in the minority here but I didn't love this book. I love leadership and I love discipline and I was hoping to hear some unique thoughts about these subjects. I had heard a recent interview from the author and was very excited about this book. I simply didn't find any of the principles on leadership or discipline to be anything more than common knowledge. If you read books on leadership before or on discipline or military books, there doesn't seem to be anything unique here, in my opinion. If you love War Stories especially in a modern context, this is an excellent book. It's well-written and fun to read. I just didn't particularly find it helpful. For leadership technique or principles of self discipline, I would not recommend this book. For stories of overcoming challenges in Modern Combat and conflict, I would recommend this book. But ultimately, given my expectations, I was pretty disappointed. I'm also disappointed at the great reviews it's got because I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here! * Edit: I went back and read some of the lower reviews and I concur with all of them. I'm glad at least a few people noticed that this book was heavy on bragging and light on principles. The 90% five star reviews are only right if you love War Stories and don't really care about leadership or self discipline.","Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin is one of those books that became an instant business school classic. I’ve owned it for a few years, and I finally decided to read it. I love reading leadership books, and I was interested to see the parallels between Willink and Babin’s military experience and the business world. When leaders receive an order that they themselves question and do not understand, they must ask the question: why? Why are we being asked to do this? Those leaders must take a step back, deconstruct the situation, analyze the strategic picture, and then come to a conclusion. If they cannot determine a satisfactory answer themselves, they must ask questions up the chain of command until they understand why. If frontline leaders and troops understand why, they can move forward, fully believing in what they are doing. I found the recaps of military missions in each chapter tedious. I lightly skimmed those recaps until getting to the Application to Business sections, where I found the most helpful information. The popularity of this book can’t be denied, so I know people enjoy the mission recaps, but whether on screen or in books, I’ve never much cared for those types of stories. I didn’t see an overarching theme or story throughout Extreme Ownership. There’s no single thread tying the stories together and each chapter, like the mission, feels very tactical. Leading up, the leader cannot fall back on his or her positional authority. Instead, the subordinate leader must use influence, experience, knowledge, communication, and maintain the highest professionalism. I found many parallels with Brene Brown’s Dare to Lead. Both books have the same concepts, with different strategies for communicating those concepts. I feel strongly you should read both and see what you learn from each.","So far not impressed. Jocko and Lief have a very naive view of combat operations between the Vietnam War and 9/11. They don't seem to know that the US Coast Guard is a branch of the military. They makes excuses for not describing real tactics because like a lot of special forces people they don't actually know what is pubic domain and what is classified (and they are too lazy to find out). Too much of their commentary is rah-rah bullshit. A lot of their leadership ideas are heavily dependent on a high trust environment with professionals. The real business world is not like that. Business is not war. Nobody cares if half the people in a meeting didn't read the agenda ahead of time because business is not life or death. ""Loopholes, created by either explosives or manual tools, allow SEAL snipers to observe and engage enemy fighters while remaining somewhat protected from enemy fire."" What is this? A bad parody of Burn Notice? When you're a SEAL...loopholes... It feels like neither of them know anything about military history. And this is all before Chapter 1."
