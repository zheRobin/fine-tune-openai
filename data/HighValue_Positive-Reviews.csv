"I liked how the author covered the many aspects of influence and used his own personal examples of when he has been “influenced” without objectively thinking before a purchase or major decision… proving we can all be manipulated at some point or other. Also, this book gave me an answer I needed regarding my own usage of influence. Where I thought I should be marketing a series of my books to single mothers of boys, I now realize my real target is the men who have grown up in a single parent (mother) households and may not realize, like I myself hadn’t, that they are more than often living the Peter Pan syndrome… boys who don’t grow up to be actual MEN… in the most masculine sense of the word. Purchase and immediately read this book. It will save you countless hours of wondering how you fell into doing things you never wanted to do.",It has great psychological explanations that you can use to increase social skills and improve your business. Recommend to anyone who wants to understand the human psyche,"I recently delved into this fascinating book on negotiation, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. The approach it takes to demystify the complexities of negotiation is both highly educational and incredibly engaging. It's not every day that you come across a read that transforms a seemingly daunting topic into something so accessible and downright exciting. What stood out to me the most was how the book breaks down negotiation tactics into digestible, actionable insights. The author has a knack for blending real-world examples with theoretical knowledge, making the art of negotiation not only approachable but also immensely intriguing. Each chapter felt like a new adventure, unraveling the intricacies of human psychology and strategic communication in ways I had never considered.",My kid is a budding vlogger/filmmaker and I've always been hesitant to give her my unwieldy DSLR camera to take pictures and video. We purchased this camera because it's specifically marketed for vloggers and it's very nice and compact. It's also light enough for small hands to to hold and control. It comes with a convenient carrying case and the quality of the images and video are top notch! She doesn't know it yet but this is her Christmas present. I'm going to test this some more by taking more outdoor footage but I like what I'm seeing so far! A+++ will purchase again for the any aspiring vlogger in my family!,"I love the look of this camera, it has a very retro feel but is modern and lightweight. The camera itself is very easy to use and has excellent features. I really like the built-in viewfinder, especially in bright situations. The camera comes with a snap-on protective case, making it very easy to transport and stay protected. Excellent image and video quality, very long battery life, and everything is included in the box so it's ready to use right away.","I owned a pair of AirPods that I in 2020. They were fantastic, but failed after 4 years of use. I used them primarily to listen to TV at night. After 4 years of use the right one would quit after about an hour of use. I decided to investigate replacing them with alternatives. I ordered a cheap pair that had an ear hook to secure them to your ear. They didn’t fit well in my ears and sounded horrible. I tried 2 different JBL earbuds. The sound was good, but they didn’t fit my ears. I tried AirPods Pro, the sound was fantastic, but they didn’t fit securely in my ears. Then I tried PowerBeats Pro. They fit securely in my ears, but the sound was tinny, not bold and had minimal bass tones. I ended up going back to AirPods Gen 2. They are fantastic!, great sound quality, lots of bass and bold sound. They fit nicely in my ears and don’t fall out. The price is reasonable too, half the price of AirPods Pro & PowerBeats Pro.","I already had a FireTV cube in one room and bought this to replace the Roku3 I had in my living room. Originally, I was going to put this in the bedroom and move the Cube to the living room, but this works so well that I didn't need to. SPEED Like my Cube, this is fast! My old Roku was constantly freezing, especially with YouTube. That's why I replaced it. Couldn't deal with it any more. This 4k Stick 2023 switches fast between apps and so far has not frozen. Plus, YouTube in this version has a speed setting so I can watch at 1.25 speed. SOUND A pleasant surprise I didn't expect is that the sound is so much better! I have this plugged into my plasma TV which uses Optical connection to my older Onkyo receiver. I used to turn the sound way up to hear the dialogue and then music, action scenes, and ads would be super loud and I would have to turn it down. I feel like I can hear the dialogue so much better now and don't need to constantly adjust the volume between scenes. My entire setup is the same so the only change was switching from the Roku to this. SETUP Easy setup since I already had it connected to my account. I didn't even need to enter my WiFi login. I still had to login to my Netflix and YouTube accounts but just used the QR codes to do that. Honestly, I did not expect the quality of the 4k Stick to be so good. And for $30 on sale? This is an incredible deal! It came with a USB cord and an AC plug for the wall in case your USB port doesn't have enough power or you just don't have one like me. If you are on the fence and stream a lot because you cut the cord, you can't go wrong with this. Highly recommended!","It's not what you do for a living that matters. It's what you do with what you do for a living that counts. In ""Blue Collar Cash,"" Ken Rusk encourages the reader to get powerfully clear on what they want from life. More than money and things, what we ultimately want is Comfort, Peace, and Freedom: achieving what matters most to us, living life on our terms, and being the person in charge of our lives. In pursuit of Comfort, Peace, and Freedom, the path to college is the right choice for some people - but not everyone. Even when it is the right path, today's graduates are often burdened with massive debt and an increasingly saturated job market. And when those jobs can be found, it can take more than a decade to pay off that debt and get established professionally. For the person seeking to avoid cubicle life, massive debt, and dreams put on hold, and (here's the important part) who is confident enough to go against conventional wisdom, there is another path: skilled trades. Think the author is overselling the idea? Look for someone to write computer code. You'll have a thousand qualified candidates. Need someone to repair your car or remodel your kitchen? You'll wait months. Or longer. And it's not because ""nobody wants to work."" It's because too many people have overlooked or outright dismissed opportunities found in skilled trade professions. And those opportunities will be massive over the next two decades, as a generation of skilled trade pros retires to enjoy the fruits of their (often very) fulfilling (and just as often, very lucrative) labors. Ken makes a powerful case that Comfort, Peace, and Freedom can be found in skilled trade professions - not to mention a living wage, competitive benefits, a humane work week, and abundant opportunities for entrepreneurship and giving back. He shares compelling stories of people who created beautiful lives for themselves, with meaningful work and a fulfilling life off the clock. Ken's best advice: Think differently about what matters. ""Love Your Work. Secure Your Future. Find Happiness for Life."" Because it turns out the American Dream isn't dead. You just might find it in a really unexpected place.","If you’re looking to learn more about finances this is a great book to add to your library. It provides a unique perspective towards to understanding how the financial world works and how psychology plays a huge factor in this realm. Furthermore it indirectly helps to (re)build self-confidence towards how one looks and “feels” about their financial situation (past, present and future). The author does an eloquent job to present the material in a way that make it easy to digest and apply what they read.","Why the book was so easy and enjoyable to read? It has a lot of good examples, data and fun facts to get the point across to the readers. The chapter titles are attention grabbers to get our attention to read more. But the most important thing to learn from this book is ""Margin of Safety"". According to the author, It is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance. It comes in many forms: a frugal budget, flexible thinking, and a loose time line - anything that lets you live happily with a range of outcomes. Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays. The book is pretty much evolved around the concept of ""Margin of Safety."" It encourages readers to save money and not spending money lavishly. The key is staying wealthy and not just getting wealthy. We can't be complacent and assume that yesterday's success translate into tomorrow's good fortune. Wealth is what you don't see. Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.","These swim shorts are perfect for a day at the beach or lake. They’re 100% polyester and dry off in a few minutes. The drawstring is good quality and instead of the cheap plastic tips they used a formed metal fastener. Makes for better quality and the string won’t fray out on you after multiple uses or times through the washing machine. On the inside they do have netting, if that’s not your thing you can always cut it out with a few snips. There are two pockets on the side that are good length. I hold an iPhone 7 without issue of it falling out, though larger phones could be an issue as there isn’t anything to keep the pocket closed. The back pocket does have velcro on the back to keep it closed. For the price, I love them and have used them in saltwater and chlorinated pools for a month with no issue of fading. The blue is still deep and the other colors pretty vibrant. If anything, they run slightly short. I got a medium and they sit about 2-3” above my knees. At 6’ with 32” waist it’s nothing major, could always go up a size and the elastic would still fit very comfortably.","Tired of juggling multiple lids, I finally gave this cup a shot. It keeps my iced coffee cold for 4+ hours, easily matching the pricier brands I've tried. The single lid design is a lifesaver, and cleaning is a breeze. Some leakage around the straw still happens if it gets knocked around, but it's way less messy than my old tumbler. Love the [color name] and the handle is surprisingly sturdy. Did some digging online and seems like the rubber ring issue is common, but most people say a quick bleach soak keeps it clean. Overall, my new go-to!","After my old plastic water bottle cracked, I finally switched to metal and I'm kicking myself for not doing it sooner! This tumbler keeps my water ice-cold for HOURS, even in the summer heat. The size means less refills throughout the day, which is a big deal when I'm busy. Love the red – makes it easy to spot in my bag. Minor bummer that it arrived scratched, but I figure with how much I use it, it was bound to happen. Still the best water bottle I've owned!","I have read this book twice and learned so much both times. If You do any advertising online this book is a much-needed book. He teaches you everything you need to know about copyright and gives you a great list of books to read after his, but I promise none of them will be as witty as his book. There were several times I actually laughed out loud. You will learn that it is not one size fits all in copyright so you can target a more targeted audience. You will learn About ""Fred"" the customer avatar and he will help you understand you target audience. You will learn what really sells people what really gets people to buy. Buy this book. You won't be disappointed!","I will admit that I am follower of Jim Edwards. Jim keeps everything real. He doesn't sugar coat it, fluff it up or spend the entire book trying to sell you everything else writes about. This book, read it, make notes in it, email Jim when you have questions. I have spent a stupid amount of money looking at how to write copy and various other resources to learn from. Jim, he breaks it down, explains things so you understand. This is the very best book on copy writing that I have read. And no, I am not getting paid for this review. Unless you have a copy writer on staff or can afford one, then like me, you need to learn to do it yourself. A pretty website/funnel page does you no good unless you have good copy.

I will be revisiting and revising periodically to implement the strategies into my business. Probably the best piece of work I have read on the subject.,"I had what I “thought” was a great meat thermometer that suddenly broke on me as I opened it to check the temperature of some meat I had on the smoker.. A family member had this one and I quickly ran over to borrow it from them to finish cooking.. As I had used it at their house in the past I knew when the time came this one would be the one I purchased.. Not only is it easy to read, it is easy to calibrate if it needs to be reset, and the best part it, it has a magnetic back so it will stick to the fridge and the ledge on the front of the smoker or the grill so you have it easily available when needed!!","My old instant-read thermometer was so bulky, I'd often skip using it and just guesstimate meat temps. This one's pocketknife design is GENIUS! I keep it in my apron, and it's so quick to flip open and get a reading. Grilled the juiciest steak ever last night, and I know it's thanks to this tool. The magnet is a nice touch for keeping it handy by the grill, and the light-up display is perfect for those evening cooks. Hope it lasts forever, but the spare battery suggests the company stands behind their product.","Before this book, I felt lost in a sea of marketing jargon. Now, I have a step-by-step plan for analyzing my ideal customer that's already paying off. The chapter on social media posting helped me revamp my social media ads, and my engagement rates have doubled! If you're tired of feeling overwhelmed by marketing, this book is a must-have.","I have a HP laptop with speakers that are less than desirable. Compound this with a lifetime of audio problems, (hard of hearing), and the speakers are pretty much useless. A set of cheap computer/desktop speakers were purchased with good results as they had a separate volume control plus a jack for headphones/earbuds. Having a small desk, It was getting crowded between the laptop, the speakers and the desk light, compounded by the fact that the whole set up is against a wall that goes out to a common hallway. This restricts my volume as I don't need to have anyone hearing what I'm doing while I am online. Thus the purchase of these headphones. I chose headphones over earbuds as my ears easily get irritated when something is inserted. My main concern was two fold. The first is I have a large head, (size 7 5/8) and past ear protection devices have been pretty much uncomfortable both against the ears and overall. The second is perspiration as sweat build up occurs after extended wear. Being quite a while since I wore headphones, (2012) I did note an improvement but was still a bit gun shy. To be honest, these were not my first choice. I initially saw a set of DJ headphones with a 9' cord which appealed to me for freedom of movement. For whatever reason, these were ordered instead. These headphones came 4 days after ordering through standard, free shipping. Arriving in a soft pack with a bubble lining, the headphones were in a box enclosed within a sleeve. This made unwrapping a bit of a challenge as I wanted to save the box in case of return. Finally gaining entry, the headphones were in a bubble wrapped bag and two sets of wiring were enclosed within another. It was then I realized my error. Throwing caution to the wind, I took them out and read the enclosed the multi language manual. This was helpful as it was discovered that the ear pieces work somewhat like a person's neck. One side rotating 90 degrees counter clockwise and the other 90 degrees clockwise. Both tilted both up and down and both have extenders to adjust to the wearer. Also noted was the padding. Both ear pieces had generous padding as well as the top of the head set. It was nice to note that both sides of the ear pieces had outlets to accomodate the speaker wires. This makes it easier to plug the side in from the source thus avoiding crossover. Two sets of wires came. The first was a red, stretchable cord with a 6.5mm plug for items like guitars and speakers on one end and a 3mm plug for the head set. The cord is 2m long but can be stretched to 3m. The second cord is a 1.2m standard cord with 3mm plugs on both ends. There is also a ""control"" button should the wearer have the headphones plugged into a phone. Assembling the pieces, I plugged the 3mm into the cheap speakers and ran a gauntlet of various apps from music to gaming. WOW! WOW! WOW! A full, rich, clear sound was experienced through both earpieces despite the plug being on the right side. Every sound was heard, no matter how subtle. I did note, however, it was a bit ""bassy"" for my preference, but I was completely overwhelmed by the sound quality. Wondering if maybe the speakers may have some influence, I plugged the headset directly into the laptop. NOPE! No change in quality and I gained a little more cord in the process. After playing for about two to three hours, It was pleasantly noted that the only time it was noted the headset was on was when I reached up to my head to scratch. Very lightweight, snug, yet comfortable even with glasses. No sweat experienced. No discomfort against the ears or atop the head. The cheap speakers were then moved and attached to another device that also had less than desirable speakers. It is unknown about the noise cancellation as the residence is pretty quiet with the exception of others going up and downstairs as well as the upstairs resident. Time will tell. These are definately a keeper. Even though I have owned these less than a day, I am totally impressed with the looks, feel, and performance of these headphones. Definately a keeper and highly recommended!!!! 04/29/2019 update. These have almost constantly on my head and I have made a couple observations. 1. Despite being ""full"" ear headphones, they are not sound blocking. On a couple of occasions, I have been hearing knocking on my door as well as the phone ringing and someone talking, even though I couldn't understand what was spoken. Both have originated about 20 feet away. 2. the head band has a tendency to slide forward towards the forehead. I haven't figured out why yet and will post when I do. Right now I am testing a couple of theories","OneOdio Wired Over Ear Headphones Studio Monitor & Mixing DJ Stereo Headsets My use case: music recording monitors (guitar, drum, vocal etc). Great value - hard to beat the price. Quality is really good, even more surprising considering the price. These could easily compete with headphones that are double or triple the cost. Passive noise cancelation is really quite good. Makes these a great choice as studio headphones. Comfort - I've found these to be plenty comfortable even for all-day sessions. Sound - can be a tad 'muddy'. Bass response is good, but bass definition not the clearest.","I love this scale. It is really nice looking, compact and light, easy to use and practical. I love that you can switch from one unit to another depending on the type of food or drink you’re measuring, and the accuracy. I would definitely recommend this product.","When I received the scale I was pleasantly surprised. The scale feels premium, and is much smaller than photos convey. The product’s photos skew the size by using small bowls and hands to throw off visual proportions. In reality, the scale is hand-sized (granted, I’m larger than most). It’s small enough to throw into a drawer, or keep it on a counter and not take up much space. It can be easily accessible, not necessary to put it away somewhere to be barely used. It’s even travel friendly (just don’t pack heavy items on top of it). Ultimately, the size is much more convenient than the photos convey. The thoroughness of the experience is also great. They didn’t create a product that just works with the bare minimum, they actually care about the user experience, and listen. Older reviews calling for additional features have been addressed. Barcode scanning is now available, the database now contains over 270,000 items.","Even though I am well into my senior years my voracious reading passion is as strong as ever, especially if it has anything to do with the U.S. Navy SEALS. Whether it is their superior fitness programs, realistic combat techniques, great swimming methods, warrior philosophy or their fantastic leadership principles, I have attempted to read everything I could find about these Special Forces Warriors. This is why when I saw this fantastic 322-page hardcover edition of (Extreme Ownership: How the U.S. Navy SEALS lead and win by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin) on Amazon I had to purchase it. This is the kind of leadership book that once you begin to read it; it is difficult to put down. This book explains how the SEAL leadership training principles apply not just to combat situations, but these same rules apply to business success and just living a full and productive life. The basic philosophical principle is simple really, but like everything in life, “the devil is in the details.” “Extreme ownership” as the combat experienced authors define it, is not making excuses and blaming mistakes made on everyone else, but taking full and complete responsibility when they are the assigned to lead their men and women. I found it interesting in this book how some so-called business leaders seem to refuse to accept the “extreme ownership” philosophy and stubbornly kept blaming everything and everyone else. In my experience, as both a regular Navy veteran, and a retired law enforcement officer, good leaders lead from the front and take full responsibility for their decisions. I love the way the authors provided examples taken from their actual combat experiences to show the importance of good leadership decisions, and they show how these very principles apply to business problems. The three parts in this excellent book covers the following: “Winning the war within, laws of combat, and sustaining victory.” There are also several very interesting color and black and white photographs included in this volume. If you are willing to face reality when it comes to taking complete responsibility in your leadership role this is a book that should be your reference source. I have read numerous other books on leadership principles, and this is one of the best ones I have read in decades. If you are blessed (or some might say cursed) with the responsibility of leading people, this book should be in your personal library as a reference and inspiring source","Jocko says in Afterword that Leadership has not changed much in thousands of years. I agree with that. I also think that by re-reading the principles through different lenses we are able to form a better understanding and own those principles. Through this book, I understand how to apply those principles clearly and how to apply Extreme Ownership to my life and career path. The straightforward nature and clear illustrations of the principles are easy to follow. I like the simple structure of the chapters. I read this on kindle and now wish I had a paper copy of the book to annotate. I also found myself wishing I had read this prior to working on or concurrently with my MBA. A valuable tool in any leader's toolbox; after all, we are only human and can stand to be reminded of these principles occasionally.","To begin I will say why these shakes are so important to me; I have 2 Idiopathic digestive system disorders Gastricparerisis and Gastricstenosis. For unknown reasons they developed weeks after I had my Gallbladder removed at 19. (It means eating solid food became unpleasant even with Boxtox injections in my valve every 18months) I was told by my gastro specialist to use Protein shakes to prolong my time before having a feeding tube placed. Finding one when you have severe allergies is not easy. I have tried a ton it feels like and had many bad experiences. I even used foods meant for babies. When first diagnosed. In 2019-20 I discovered Premier Protein Shakes they were a game changer for me because they have no soy and use sunflower oil. So I can drink them without taking benadryl first. There are only 2 flavors I must avoid Chocolate Peanut butter and Cafe Latte do to the Legume and Caffeine content. I don't feel salty about this because they make so many other great flavors. I have tried every flavor I could and will say a little bit at the end for each one. By far though my favorite is Cake Batter Delight. When life hands me a lemon I have a Cake Batter Delight. When I first started using these shakes I was on two anti-nausea meds and was really struggling. I couldn't even drink a whole bottle in 24 hours. I am now on 1 nausea med as needed. I can on a low digestion day (no solid food) drink 2. Usually though I drink one for my dinner and have slider (semi solid or ground food ) during the day. Now please don't misunderstand I am not claiming they cured me. What they have done was bring me out of a state of malnutrition as my doctors and dietician explained. So I feel better and can do normal things and not live in a hospital or a foot from a bathroom. I still have all my conditions. The feeding tube as I age is still probable. Those with chronic illness will understand the Spoon theory. Primer Protein allows me to have more spoons available which, means a improved quality of life. Now I have had some cons with this product. Heat and cold seems to clump it up. So on the east coast I see the Premier ""worms"" (they aren't parasites I showed a doctor)like people mention twice a year. It's separation of the protein blend from the water and oil. So I strain my shakes before drinking. On a few occasions I have experienced receiving spoiled shakes shipped to me or purchased locally do to a defect in the sealing process I was told. The retailers quickly resolved the issue. It's only happened Once here on Amazon and it was quickly resolved. The new clear bottle and red cap design seems to have ended the spoilage issue as it was the white bottle and cap with paper cap that was a problem in my experince. Much of the time I can find it fairly priced there have been some times I saw it and thought is it April 1st? Overall a awesome product I would give my highest recommendation","""The information is laid out in concise blocks that are easy to digest and there's no jargon to make it seem mysterious.
