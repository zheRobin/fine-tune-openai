"These protein shakes are the best on the market! Tastes just like a vanilla milkshake and has 30g protein and very low in sugar. Just give them a good shake and drink it up. No yucky protein shake taste, just pure goodness. Great for meal replacement or just drinking to get more protein in your diet. Vanilla is my favorite, but all of the flavors are great. Definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a good high protein shake!","I absolutely love Premier Liquid Protein Shake in Caramel flavor! It is so delicious and satisfying, making it the perfect post-workout treat or on-the-go snack. With 30g of protein and only 1g of sugar, this shake keeps me feeling full and energized without any guilt. I also love that it is packed with 24 vitamins and minerals to support my immune health. The convenience of having them in a 12 pack makes it easy to grab one whenever I need a quick and nutritious boost. I highly recommend this protein shake to anyone looking for a tasty and nutritious way to fuel their body!","Pros: -Accurate Measurements: Provides measurements in different unit conversions and includes a tare button for convenience. -Stainless Steel Construction: Durable material that resists corrosion and is easy to maintain. -Versatility: Suitable for various kitchen tasks, enhancing its usefulness in meal preparation. -LCD Display: Features an easy-to-read display for clear visibility of measurements. -Compact Size: Medium-sized scale is lightweight and easy to store, adding to its convenience.

It is really nice looking, compact and light, easy to use and practical. I love that you can switch from one unit to another depending on the type of food or drink you‚Äôre measuring, and the accuracy. I would definitely recommend this product.","I really struggle getting in my protein each day and this has been a lifesaver. I'm losing weight and have been losing hair so this protein shake combined with some other supplements has helped my hair grow back. It tastes so great and my daughter loves it too! You got to try the other flavors like the coffee one which has some caffeine, that's a plus for me, and the strawberry and cream is really delicious.",I liked this book because it‚Äôs a action plan for getting from where you are to where you you want to be!! You can‚Äôt just dream about the life you want. You have to take action and this successful book with help you get there,"I checked this book out at the library and after reading it, I decided it was something I needed for reference the rest of my life! I'm always interested in self improvement and have read a lot of books, this one is definitely in the run for the best. I also bought the workbook. Sometimes we need a nudge. This book did that for me.","Unlike other books that tell you what to do, this book tells you how to do it. If you are a small business owner, I highly recommend you read this book. I bought one for myself, one for a friend, and one for my niece, who just graduated from college.",These kind of data is very old for me but still it helps to understand a thing or two.,"ALL THE LINKS ARE DEAD. Actually... They redirect, but it'd be nice if the resources were just as easily accessible as they once were. The author is fantastic and there is probably NO other resource necessary, once you've got this baby dialed in. Yeah he has upsells, but so what... he's a marketer. The book delivers. I'd give it 5 stars if the mentioned resources were still available. Still, I'd recommend this to any business owner who needs a simple step by step framework on how to get their marketing assets in place, what to include and why.","Before reading the book, i often struggled with branding in both myself and my company. I had too much to say! But the framework proposed by Donald Miller is definitely excellent in helping me condense and frame my speech and brand. The model is deceptively simple and belies much thought and work for anyone after, but worth is nonetheless.",Great resource but focuses heavily on services business and not many examples of e-commerce/product co strategies that can be easily implemented. Enjoyable though.,"It offers a good roadmap to follow with tips and rules based in common sense but refined in a way that convices you to, at least, try your best to apply this knowledge. I don't know if it is going to work, but it definitely gave me a structure to think about my brand's marketing, and that is a lot","I needed a scale that was small, easy to use and accurate for my sourdough starter and baking and this nailed all three. So happy with the slick design","The simplicity of use, and accuracy of measurements are great! This scale has the various measurements that I needed. I love it, and the price was wonderful!","I‚Äôve started my sourdough journey and most recipes call for using grams instead of cups for measuring ingredients. I tried using cups and wasn‚Äôt getting any success. After much research and comparison of kitchen scales, I decided to try this one. I‚Äôm so glad I did! It works beautifully! It‚Äôs very easy to use, accurate, easy to cancel out the weight of your original item using the ‚Äútare‚Äù button. I only wish I had this item sooner! It‚Äôs been a game changer for me in my kitchen and in my sourdough journey! Highly recommend! :)","The Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Digital Kitchen Scale is a culinary game-changer, exceeding expectations in every way.

Definitely worth the investment.",This book is packed with actionable insights and practical strategies for modern marketing. The author breaks down complex concepts into easy-to-understand steps. It has completely changed how I think about reaching my target audience and building a successful brand.,"These headphones sound incredible! The bass is deep and punchy, the highs are crisp, and the overall soundstage is immersive. They're also really comfortable to wear for long periods and the noise cancellation is top-notch. Best headphones I've owned.","My air fryer has become my new best friend in the kitchen! It cooks food quickly and evenly, with way less oil than traditional frying. I've made everything from crispy chicken wings to perfect roasted vegetables. It's easy to clean and saves me so much time. A must-have kitchen appliance.","I never thought I needed a smartwatch, but now I don't know how I lived without it! It tracks my fitness goals, lets me see notifications without pulling out my phone, and even has contactless payment options. The design is sleek and the battery life lasts for days. I'm really impressed.","This backpack is exactly what I needed for my upcoming trip. It has tons of compartments to keep my things organized, padded straps for comfort, and seems really durable. It's the perfect size for carry-on luggage, and I love the stylish look. Can't wait to take it on adventures!",This throw pillow adds the perfect pop of color to my living room. The fabric is soft and the design is super cute. It's well-made and seems like it will hold up over time. Great way to update my space without spending a lot.,"This game is so much fun! The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is addictive, and the story is engaging. I've been playing for hours and can't put it down.

I've noticed a big improvement in my skin's texture and fewer breakouts. My new favorite skincare product.,"I've always wanted a portable Bluetooth speaker to take with me on the go, and this one seems to fit the bill. The sound quality is decent for its size, and it connects easily to my devices. I like the waterproof design, so I don't have to worry about it getting splashed at the beach or pool. The battery life could be a bit better, but overall, it's a solid speaker for the price.","I decided to try out a fitness tracker to help me stay motivated with my exercise goals. This one has all the basic features I was looking for ‚Äì step tracking, heart rate monitoring, and sleep tracking. The app is user-friendly and gives me a good overview of my daily activity. It's comfortable to wear, and I like that it's waterproof. I'm not sure how accurate all the measurements are, but it's definitely helped me become more aware of my activity levels.","I'm a big fan of this author's previous works, so I was excited to read their latest novel. The writing is as engaging as always, and I found myself quickly drawn into the story. The plot has some interesting twists and turns that kept me guessing. However, the ending felt a bit rushed and didn't quite deliver the emotional impact I was expecting. Still, a worthwhile read for fans of the genre.","This tent seems like a great option for family camping trips. It's spacious enough to fit four people comfortably, and the setup was surprisingly easy. I appreciate the extra vestibule area for storing gear and the mesh windows for ventilation. We haven't tested it in heavy rain yet, so I can't comment on its waterproofness. But so far, seems like a good value for the price.","I wanted to upgrade my old drip coffee maker, and this model had good reviews. It makes a delicious cup of coffee, and I love the option to brew different sizes. The programmable timer is a lifesaver on busy mornings. It's easy to clean, and I appreciate the sleek design that doesn't take up too much counter space. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.","As a college student, I've come to expect textbooks to be dry and overly technical. This one, however, was a pleasant surprise. The author does a great job of explaining complex concepts in a clear and concise way. There are plenty of real-world examples that help illustrate the material, making it much easier to grasp. The end-of-chapter summaries and practice questions are also valuable tools for reinforcing my understanding. While I wouldn't say it's the most exciting read, it's certainly one of the more accessible textbooks I've encountered.","I'm an avid hiker and take good care of my gear. My last pair of boots finally wore out after years of use, so I spent a lot of time researching my next purchase. These boots seemed promising with their durable construction and rave reviews. I've taken them on a few shorter hikes so far to break them in, and they feel comfortable and supportive. The traction seems good on various terrains. I'm hoping they hold up well over time, as they were quite an investment. Overall, I'm cautiously optimistic that they'll live up to the hype.","My family loves playing board games, and we're always looking for new ones to add to our collection. This one caught our eye with its unique theme and positive reviews. The instructions were a bit confusing at first, but we eventually figured them out. The gameplay itself is fun and engaging, with a good mix of strategy and luck. There's a decent amount of replayability, as there are different paths to victory you can explore. I wouldn't recommend it for casual players, but if you enjoy more complex games, it's worth checking out.","Working from home has made me realize the importance of a comfortable office chair. After reading numerous reviews, I decided to give this one a try. The assembly was straightforward, and the chair offers a good range of adjustability. The lumbar support is decent, and I like the breathable mesh material. I'm not sure if it will provide enough support for all-day use yet, but so far, it's a major improvement over my old dining chair.","I've struggled to achieve salon-worthy blowouts at home, so I decided to invest in this highly-rated hair styling tool. It definitely takes some practice to get the hang of it, but the results are impressive. My hair looks smooth and shiny, and the style lasts for days. It cuts my drying time in half, which is a major bonus. The different attachments offer some versatility for creating different looks. While expensive, it seems to be well-made and I'm hoping it lasts for a long time.",Where have you been all my life!? I got this brilliant tumbler at a very reasonable price. I can‚Äôt get over how beautiful the color is and how useful it is. I originally bought this for a Mexico trip but started using it as an everyday water bottle as my plastic bottle broke and also I was looking for a plastic free option and I love it! It‚Äôs light and big enough for my high hydration needs. Also fits cup holders and won‚Äôt spill easily at all. It came a bit scratched so beware of that but I didn‚Äôt return it as I know I‚Äôll scratch it eventually‚Ä¶still 5*!!!,"The folding design of this thermometer makes it kind of like a pocketknife, which turns on the display when you open it and turns off when closed. The grip is like that of a folding knife and easy to hold on to. It seems accurate enough. I just grilled a rack of lamb to perfect medium rare. The display lights up if you need it in dark conditions, and it is magnetic so that it sticks to a steel surface on the grill. It also includes a spare battery. There is a ‚Äúlifetime warranty‚Äù, which I suppose is legit, but I expect there are terms and conditions. The construction seems sturdy enough, so hopefully I won‚Äôt need to find out. I purchased it on a Black Friday deal, so it was moderately priced.","""Practical tips and advice to avoid novice mistakes when crafting sales & marketing offers. Additional material is provided as †bonus online.""","""very informative, simple to digest, i think it could be shorter cause there is concepts repeating themselves, but overall great book""","""As a small-business owner, I really enjoyed this book\u2026 especially how practical it is. So, why 4 stars instead of 5? Well, there are a few sales tips that Hormozi SAYS are ethical and moral, but that are actually kind of sketchy. But that said, it did contain a lot of practical advice.""","""Disclaimer: I HAVE NOT read any of this book yet. This review is soley based on my first impression of the print (which is not good).For the record, I enjoy the hell out of Alex's content. Based on the quality of said content, I'm willing to suspend any negative sentiment toward him and his team. I'm also fairly confident that the actual written content of this book is phenomenal. As a testament to this, I willingly chose to forego the cheaper digital/audible editions, opting instead to invest in this full-price printed copy.That being said, this is absolutely the most subpar print quality I have ever encountered in any book. The images appear to have undergone severe compression, presumably in an attempt to conserve ink. The attached table forces me to strain my eyes, overshadowing its intended impact as a meaningful example. The photo of the hand-written note is rendered practically illegible due to poor lighting, leaving me to wonder if there was truly no feasible way to enhance its clarity even slightly. The presentation falls egregiously short of the excellence expected from such a remarkable content creator and businessman.What else can I say? I'm honestly dissapointed. I waited so eagerly for this book (3 weeks overseas), only to find it was delivered without enough care to even fully render the example images.But hey, congratulations. You made the sale.""","""Terrible Language and Not made for product sellers"", ""Description"": ""Content may work for people selling services, or courses, but totally inapplicable to product sellers.

It is floppy and cumbersome to read.""","""Insightful, succinct, and seems to be from someone who's been through it all before.
