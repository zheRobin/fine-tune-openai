Heavily skewed to service and consulting industries which isn’t clear in the title. Some reads may feel bait and switched.",

If you've seen the video, I don't recommend the book.  Alex, you need to step up the printing of this book. It screams cheap when you stand for over delivering on value.  Suggest including different content than the transcript of the videos if you say the book is more detailed.  It's a red flag.  From your videos I feel that I deeply trust you and feel strongly connected to you.  I often think \"I love this guy, he's so inspiring!\".

  "reviewDescription": "Disclaimer: I HAVE NOT read any of this book yet. This review is soley based on my first impression of the print (which is not good).For the record, I enjoy the hell out of Alex's content. Based on the quality of said content, I'm willing to suspend any negative sentiment toward him and his team. I'm also fairly confident that the actual written content of this book is phenomenal. As a testament to this, I willingly chose to forego the cheaper digital/audible editions, opting instead to invest in this full-price printed copy.That being said, this is absolutely the most subpar print quality I have ever encountered in any book. The images appear to have undergone severe compression, presumably in an attempt to conserve ink. The attached table forces me to strain my eyes, overshadowing its intended impact as a meaningful example. The photo of the hand-written note is rendered practically illegible due to poor lighting, leaving me to wonder if there was truly no feasible way to enhance its clarity even slightly. The presentation falls egregiously short of the excellence expected from such a remarkable content creator and businessman.What else can I say? I'm honestly dissapointed. I waited so eagerly for this book (3 weeks overseas), only to find it was delivered without enough care to even fully render the example images.But hey, congratulations. You made the sale.",

  "reviewDescription": "$100M Offers is an excellent book in more than one way. First of all, I want to scream from the rooftops how amazing the concept of this book itself is.I’m in the book advertising business. Long ago (read: a few years back), I noticed how great an opportunity creating books was for business owners. You can sell the book, let people get to know you and your offer, and give them an incentive to go back for more.I’m an author myself, and I know firsthand how common readers can turn into great customers. Yet, when I tried to explain my concept, very few entrepreneurs got it. And finding an entrepreneur who not only understood it, but implemented it in the right way, is as hard as trying to find a unicorn.Alex Hormonzi is a unicorn, and then some.He didn’t just write a book to lure readers and turn them into customers. He wrote a book, so they could grow their businesses to even qualify as his prospects! This is my concept taken to another level. And the execution was flawless too.No Weak PointsI couldn’t see any CONS of $100M Offers. This book is just great. Short, to the point, yet incredibly meaty.Like very few books I read, it was written with the specific goal in mind and it sticks to this agenda rigidly. The book also reads very well. It’s written in plain English. It’s extremely quotable. And the how-to in the book is pure gold.PROS$100M Offers has many advantages. I will just highlight several points that caught my attention.1. Amazing Business Book.As I said – pure gold. This book is packed full with so many business tips. I’m a half-time entrepreneur and my business is miniscule. I’m faraway from making $3M to qualify as Alex’s prospect. Yet, I learned a lot. I’m in a better position to close the gap between where I am now (a way below $100k) and being prospect-worthy for Alex.And that’s the proof of his idea. Alex published a book. A guy in faraway Poland read it, heard about him, loved his content, and got to know him as a person.Now, I have much better chances to ever make $3M. And Alex increased his chances to get a new client in the future. And he made 33 cents (the Kindle royalties) in the process. 😀As a greenhorn, I got the most out of Sections II and III. I got the feeling in which kind of business I am and which type of entrepreneur I am.The most impactful business advice for me? Here:\"No one can serve two masters.(…)”“If you are under $10M per year, niching down will make you more money.”Intellectually, I’ve known for a long time I need to niche down. I was just too lazy to ever try. I like doing many things.But I’m a way below the $10M cap, and I definitely could’ve used more money. Right here, right now.2. Business Philosophy Close to My Heart.Alex is a way better entrepreneur than me. Yet, the principles he teaches are the principles I live by. I guess this is why this book made so much sense for me.\"Some people get there slowly. But everyone gets there eventually, as long as you don’t give up.”Perseverance is a key to success. And I’m definitely the ‘getting there slowly’ guy. I need time to process things. I need time to accommodate to change. But I also never give up. I’m much closer to financial independence now than nine years ago when I published my first book.\"Entrepreneurship is about acquiring skills, beliefs, and character traits.”Amen. Most people easily grasp a need for acquiring skills. Much fewer understand a necessity to change one’s mindset. But acquiring character traits?! This is something so ‘out there’ that people just shrug it off.However, this is how you become an entrepreneur and grow as one. 10 years ago, I was an ordinary employee. I never had led even one person in my life. When I realized I need to own a business to reach a lifestyle I desired, I also realized I’m the worst possible material for entrepreneurship. Thus, I decided to work on myself, on my character, not skills. In several months, I started making money outside of my day job for the first time in my life. In several years, I started my own business. Now, my team consists of seven people working for me regularly and a few contractors.I couldn’t made it if I started from acquiring skills.3. Personal Approach.Alex starts his book from a gut-wrenching personal story. While I never experienced such an enormous pressure like him – I am way too risk-averse to bet everything I own on my business – I could easily relate. He won me by this story.\"Entrepreneurship is a crazy rollercoaster. I dipped into my savings to pay my people or business bills all too often. I had business disasters (my blog was hacked; twice) and unexpected business opportunities (people reaching out to me out of the blue to buy my services).”The author skillfully sprinkled his personal stories throughout the book. They took very little volume of the book, but they are very memorable.I remembered best the one close to the end, when Alex described how he felt, when he finally got over $100,000 in his personal account. Quoting him:\"Tens of millions of dollars in the bank later, it was, and still is, the richest I have ever felt in my life.”4. Money Mindset.Now, there are many experts on business tactics and strategies. There are very few experts on shaping one’s money mindset to earn s*it loads of money.\"Making s*it loads of money breaks people’s minds.”Personally, it breaks my mind to make more than 98% of my country population. I struggle to grow my business because I have ‘it all.’ I definitely can rub off some abundance mindset from Alex.He very smartly explained why entrepreneurs should charge so much that it hurts. Thanks to $100M Offers I’m slowly stretching my money mindset, charging 2-6 times more than I had charged.5. Excellent Detailed Advice.Have I mentioned the nitty-gritty advice? Just one example:10x to 1/10th test.\"If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000) what would I provide? If they paid me 1/10th the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that?”Wow, talking about stretching your mind! And this is just a single exercise out of dozens instanced in the book.6. Amazing Quotes.Alex definitely has the gift of words. Just a sample of powerful quotes from $100M Offers:\"Humans suffer a lot. So for us entrepreneurs, endless opportunity abounds.”Great authors have great ability to describe reality. Drop mic. It also gave me a moment of reflection upon the human condition. This is reality. We suffer. We have always suffered, and always will. Like almost everything, it has bad aspects (hurt) and good ones – like endless opportunities to alleviate our neighbors’ sufferings.\"The person who needs the exchange less always has the upper hand.”This helped me realize why I’m still in the business. I always have had an upper hand. I do not care for my prospects’ ‘yes.’ After a few years, I exactly know with whom I want to work. Definitely, I don’t want to work with authors who cannot trust me.\"Scarcity is a function of quantity. Urgency is a function of time.”So succinct. So aptly said. Two greatest sales functions described in a dozen words.SummaryDo you want to grow your company to $3M-$50M? You will not get a better textbook on that subject than $100M Offers. And you will get it for just 99 cents.This is an absolute no-brainer. It’s also the no-brainer for anyone remotely interested in business in general. You cannot get a better education for a smaller fee than this book.",

However, this review is specifically on the $100 million offers.This is one of the best books I’ve ever read. It is formatted, so neatly, with clear and concise information. There are so many gems in here on marketing, psychology, business, entrepreneurship, sales, and of course offers. This is so well-written, relatable, and really makes you stay accountable in your business. I have had multiple business coaches in the past tell me that I need to raise my prices. I was hesitant at first, because I didn’t want to feel like I was charging way too much for something, but Alex talks about how by raising your prices to a much higher level, consequently you will be able to provide even more value for your clients/customers. Your program or product will be of even higher value. For example, I sell personal training mastery programs. Just for the sake of math, let’s say I charged $500 for a program. If I wanted to make $10,000 in a month, I have to sell 20 programs and have 20 clients. I also need to keep track of, organize, and assist 20 people. If I charged $5000, I would need two clients. I would spend all my time and attention on those two, giving them extraordinary support, motivation, guaranteed results, etc. I was very hesitant to raise prices, but when you realize you can absolutely do it in a good way, morally and ethically, whilst actually giving much more value, attention, reassurance, and results to a customer, it’s a no-brainer. Either way, this is, one of the best books I’ve ever read. Thank you so much, Alex. God bless you for all your hard work.",

He speaks about how liposuctions costs a load of money, whereas a gym membership is 20$ a month, but because the perceived value of liposuction is much higher, because of how short of a time it takes, how you don’t need to sacrifice eating habits, etc… its value is much higher. He brings out what we know as value, and takes an outside look on it. He seems to be very well educated about why people work the way that they work and how you can capitalize on that. I would admit, throughout the book he is trying to sell you his business of acquisition.com, but in order to buy and upsell your 10M$+ business, you need to have a 10M$ business in the first place, which is what he’s trying to do by having you read this book. He provides a lot of value and very well shows how he practices what he preaches, providing lots of valuable information for such a cheap price, when compared to the value this book provides.

I'm working on my offer for a product in the education space. The single most valuable insight I've gained from this book so far is that I should continue to do the boring work, for a long time, until I am ridiculously good at it.  I've refined a teaching system for about 4 years as a private educator and now I'm working on getting good at writing and video production to launch this system as a 1 to many product. I'm not finished with the book yet so I haven't gotten to the part where I get a roadmap for sales, so all I can say at this point is I am hoping to gain insight on how to make my product sell.",

  "reviewDescription": "Though I didn't find alot that I feel I can use in my b2b wholesale distribution of consumer goods I am grateful to see someone who is successful willing to share useful information without trying to generate more wealth. I follow many successful entrepreneurs and have even invested more than I could really afford to get information from them.I've always wondered if they are truly as successful as they promote why do they charge so much to \"help\" others who are at the first rung of the ladder. So thank you Alex. I will continue to soak up everything you offer and take every nugget I can find to apply to my business until I get to the $3m to engage you 1on 1 😉. Continue to be blessed and being a blessing.",

If it were, wouldn’t we all be rich? Key points are basic marketing principles; know your target audience, make sure to meet their need and that they are in a position to pay your fees. Overcharge 100%, and justify this with value. Clients respect services offered at a higher price bc of perceived quality superiority. If the client barters or dares to question your high price, then he’s an idiot for not seeing your worth. In all, this book is a lot of bs. He just makes it sound way too easy.",

I was wrong.Too much words are dedicated to “storytelling” trying to convey some emotional type of contact. The fact is that is annoying, for me, for this type of book: I’m not reading a novel, but a “guide” where I don’t want to read anything emotional. I am not interested in personal stories if the intent is to understand more of a specific topic.This is not in polemic tone, just my thoughts on this book that I hope can help to better understand what to expect from it.",

Alex has created what I’d call a “taste of success.” From start to finish, this book covers everything from scaling to building MULTIPLE empires.If your goal as an entrepreneur is one of these four pillars- health, wealth, love & happiness- then read this book. If it isn’t, then stay stagnant and make “just enough” to say you’ve made it. Anyone can do that, so don’t just be anyone.Now stop reading this review, scroll up, buy this book and start taking action!",

Like I said, he makes offers a lot more efficient. I’ve gotten a lot more clarity out of how I want to offer my service. To be honest, I still need to read the rest of the book to figure out how I’m going to communicate the value of my service, but from what I’ve read so far it seems that I’m going to have a much clearer picture on how to do so.

Alex does a great job of outline and providing value in this book. I did though feel like it was a bit gimmicky at points but might just have to do with the fact that the book leans towards sales and marketing.Still fantastic read and love the value he provides in the book.",

At first I was like \"wait, why is it so big...\" but I LOVE that it's the size it is - can take notes (you'll want to constantly and underline things) and it has such helpful visuals.  I love how it's written, no fluff, so easy to understand and with personal stories and examples to help make the lessons extremely tangible.  I blocked a weekend day to go through this book and I'm so excited to begin applying the lessons.  Very satisfied so far!  My perceived likelihood of achievement is high ;)  Thank you for the easy concepts, the straightforward teaching, and the supplemental learnings online.  THANK YOU!",

The training seems to be legit and super insightful and helpful. Given that I’m only 4 Chapters in on the audio version.So, Why The 3 Star ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Review ?I feel like the amount of “F Bombs” 💣 is just unnecessary. I am sure this entrepreneur and author is way smarter and more intelligent than to result to vulgar language to express his points of views, frustrations , and disappointments. I am almost positive he could have found more impactful words than just simply using vulgar and offensive  language.Such ashame. To spend months on sculpting and writing ✍️ this book to help change and sculpt peoples minds and thoughts only to deliver with vulgar offensive language seems like such a waste of talent and opportunity.And, hear me out. I’m not saying to not be yourself, and speak in ways that are authentic to you, but keep in mind not every customer is interested in spending their hard earned money on reading “F Bombs sprinkled throughout every so many paragraphs”.However, if you don’t mind every other few paragraphs with F Bombs and that doesn’t bother you, you will probably find this book super helpful and insightful.",

  "reviewDescription": "A medio libro el autor pide que el lector valore la experiencia y aquí estoy como buen mandado. No puedo evitar mencionar que el autor no sabe escribir el apellido del famoso actor de Hollywood también conocido como ex gobernador de California (lo menciona varias veces y no repite la misma errata…) da hasta la sensación de que es intencionado pero no entiendo por qué. Dicho esto, el libro es muy entretenido, fácil de devorar en pocas horas, y cuenta con muchos ejemplos prácticos de cómo funciona el comportamiento humano a la hora de comprar. El caso es que, en algunos puntos se contradice y pierde coherencia, sin restarle nada de entretenimiento, eso sí. Me lo volvería a comprar si prometiese escribir bien el nombre completo de su amigo y si limara esas incoherencias.",

  "reviewDescription": "At around only 150 pages, filled with iPad doodles and typed in 14pt font almost double spaced - oh, and he plugs his business in almost every chapter - this book has some useful nuggets, but Hormozi has done exactly what he advises in his book: 'ask for the highest price you can without breaking a smile'. If this was written in traditional format, it'd probably be as thick as a brochure. But, sure, word count doesn't necessarily equal value.The TL;DR is Hormozi has been there, done that, so although there's not a lot of words in this book... it does have a lot of useful info which a beginner to business would find easy to understand and immediately applicable.He repeats some age old business wisdom, albeit in a more accessible way. I would recommend it for people starting out with business books because he explains important concepts in a way that everybody can grasp, and there are - as with any business book - new ways of looking at things and novel tips. The difference with Hormozi is he's done everything he talks about - whereas other business books are more theoretical - so this book is more practical and his stories inspiring.As this is apparently Volume 1... I ask myself if I would buy volume 2. I'm really not sure, hence 3 stars.",

The first being an industrial construction company(>$1m annual rev) that failed due to my own mismanagement and lack of understanding of the client/customer relationship in the defense contraction sector, the second being an investment in a tech startup that failed to launch due to lack of due diligence on my part and lack of understanding value within the industry marketed to.This book provides easy to digest insight into concepts that I have previously overlooked or failed to even consider when adopting pricing strategies and marketing/selling our services. I simply joined in the \"race to the bottom\" mentality Alex highlights.I am currently building a business in the highly competitive vacation rental industry and have been at a loss for ways to differentiate our model from others in the field. This book has reignited my idea mill and really stoked the motivational fire.

  "reviewDescription": "This book is great.  First, without being motivational, 'ra ra' hype, it's motivational to get you into gear and doing things for your business.  It's not necessarily new concepts for anyone who's been in business longer than a year or two, but it certainly packages ideas in a digestible and actionable way.  Seriously, if you own a business, you need read to this book, even if you're doing well.  Because balance is BS.Why only 4-stars?  While I love the content of the book, the physical size of the book is big & cumbersome.  at 13\" tall, it's physically awkward to read (and no, I'm not going to read the kindle version,  to make a better form factor, for me, this content needs to be physically in my hands).  I would have preferred a more traditional binding size than this large factor book that most children would read.  Unless that was the intent to take us back to childhood and be playful with our business.  Simply put, this book is good for reading at home, but I wouldn't find myself throwing it in my carry-on for a flight due to its size.  Hopefully the next volume will have a better form factor.",

  "reviewDescription": "This feels like a great breakdown of how to create a compelling product that people will want to buy. It's highly logical and clear in it's delivery.  The claims made and the advice given often set off lightbulbs in my head - things that seem self evident in retrospect but I hadn't considered.  It's also fairly brief and to the point; as simple as possible but no simpler, as Einstein once remarked.However there are a couple of points that prevent me from giving it 5 stars ( I would give 4.5 if I could).Firstly, although it sets out to be a general purpose book that applies to any product and any market, it often in practice applies more to the kinds of business that the author has experience in (b2b consulting). There are various points where it felt like the recommendations wouldn't apply so much to e.g. ecommerce or the sale of physical goods. Having said that, there's plenty of nuggets in the book that would crossover to any business.My second gripe is with his value equation. Simply put, it's nonsense. He claims that value (ie the value that an offer provides to a customer) is expressed by:  (dream outcome * probability of achieving the outcome) /  ( time delay * costs and inconveniences involved for customer in achieving the outcome).The problem is that this implies that if the dream outcome is achieved instantly, then it has infinite value to the customer. This is ludicrous. If i sell you a car worth 10k, delivering it instantly doesn't magically make it worth infinity dollars. Nor does it make sense to say that it's worth infinity dollars if the customer doesn't have to expend any effort or expense (apart from the ticket price) in acquiring the car.  What's truly bizarre is that the author specifically says that he designed the equation DELIBERATELY so as to imply these infinite value scenarios. He doesn't explain why he did, only that he did.  So he's apparently proud of having produced an absurdity. If I'm missing something here, so be it, but it would have been nice if he had addressed this concern. I feel like this concept of a value equation has legs, but the 'time delay' should be a power law, similar to discounted cash flow, and the cost-effort part should just be subtracted from the value/probability/time part rather than a denominator.All in all though, I would highly recommend this book.",

I appreciate the balance between striving to be successful in business by making a ton of money and creating value, yet at the same time, focus on making the world a better place with the value you put in it.  If you receive a lot, you can also give a lot.  As one of the quotes in the book says, \"He who said money can't buy happiness, hasn't given enough away.\"  Just think about how much you can serve others with the success that you receive.Highly recommend this book.",

It’s not that there’s no effort but it seems like he can guarantee success, and he does it for free or at almost no cost (he has the audiobook for Offers and Leads, or most of it, posted for free on his podcast), which seems sketchy.  However, when you think about his and Leila’s current venture, Acquisition.com, it would [italics] greatly behoove [italics] them to cultivate even more successful businesses, because *that’s their target audience.* So.  I’m taking a chance on Alex and his methods (which are echoed by other successful entrepreneurs, like Bedros Keuilian whose net worth is at least $200M now) — which is greatly appreciated because, when you jump into the world of entrepreneurship without a background in it, it feels like you are destined to fail.  With Alex’s books, and the “mentorship” he offers through YouTube and his podcast, (and God’s grace), it feels like there’s a road where there was no road previously. If you’re just getting into business, or if you’ve been in business and haven’t been successful, I would definitely recommend this series of books (and Alex’s insights in general).  If I end up being a success, I’ll update my review haha",

  "reviewDescription": "I’ve been a big fan of Alex for awhile and have found his online content invaluable. I wasn’t fully sure what added value this book was going to give since I already consume so much of Alex’s online content, but what I’ve found is that it is 10x more helpful going through the method of *how to apply* what Alex teaches to your business. Also, his visuals and charts in the book are very helpful. Alex is a real one, and I can’t recommend this book enough. He delivers.",
