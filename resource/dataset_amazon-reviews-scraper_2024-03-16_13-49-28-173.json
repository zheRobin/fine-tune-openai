After reading it I don't really understand why it is so highly rated. If you are reading this book, I assume you are already in the business sphere. Nothing you read here is original or insightful. Its everything that has been said and stated before. There are better books out there on sales strategy and online market strategy. Just listening to some Gary Vee videos will tell you everything you need to know about creating and posting content much better than this book.  The only good thing about this book is the simplicity with which it is laid out. Its written in a \"business for dummies\" format which makes it digestible but it doesn't really have all that much to say. I wouldn't recommend it, its pretty vapid",

IF you are a complete beginner to Lead Generation then you will definitely benefit but you should be going to THE true experts like Russel Brunson and the aforementioned Grant Cardone ... After all .. that's what Hormozi did. His first two books were very good ... This one isn't.Just keep in mind he does have something to sell you ...

I remember a great quote from one of Hormozis podcasts:\" One product and one marketing channel will get you to 10 million.\"All of the lead generating channels are a science of the their own. The book just scratches the surface with some bullet points. Maaan and how many leads you have generated for the book is probably mentioned around 30 times.Do yourself a favour and skip this one!!",

Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.At an early point in the book the author admits that his books look like children's books (they really do, in tone, style, and frankly also in content) and raves about keeping things simple. I'd add to that the word \"overly\" ...to the point of lacking value (unless you're really a kid).",

I haven’t even had the book 24 hours and I’ve devoured it. This will be my marketing and lead generation “bible” as I launch my own business. Thank goodness I chose to go to the person who actually gives away all his secrets! I am thanking the heavens this book was placed in my life. And the funny thing is, I purchased the book after watching ONE of his free videos that had so much value I knew I needed both of his books. He practices what he preaches and it worked on me!

Buying a copy of his book is such a small penitence to pay to support, not to mention the insane value he's about to upload into your brain 🧠 and the fire 🔥 he'll light in your soul! I'm fully plan to implement his teachings, and report back as the next successful hustler/case study. Enough said! Much love, change your trajectory and get on board with this man! Cheers.P.S.- To the author, Alex, if you ever read thru your reviews, I can only imagine the tens of thousands, even 💯's of thousands you receive... I want to say thank you directly! You are changing the word for the better and I can go on and on about the special things I see & hear, but I wanna keep it short. You're kickin' a** , and hopefully I implement your system well enough to change the future with you. Maybe even cross paths one day and shake your hand, you are one of a kind. Cheers, brother!",

(I love doing that). There are pictures and diagrams, and I took Alex’s advice and listen to the audiobook while I read the print version. Game changer! Also, he doesn’t hold anything back. He explains concepts thoroughly, and gives examples as well as action steps to complete after each teaching point. I only regret I didn’t read it earlier. You totally have to check this out! Thanks Alex! Jen",

This book is NOT that and I find that extremely refreshing. It is educational and I know that implementing everything will be a game-changer in my business!",

No disrespect, someone with zero marketing literacy could skip a Marketing 101 class with this book, and gain the knowledge and fundamentals of basic marketing and lead generation.If that’s you, excellent!

  "reviewDescription": "Alex é um excelente marqueteiro com seu jeitão meio tio do churrasco que enriqueceu e tem boas sacadas neste novo livro.O livro em si é bacana e tem algumas sacadas de campo de batalha que valem a pena para quem já está em jogo e aplica. Por exemplo, alguns pensamentos diferentes de como escalar ADs com menos esforço e uma explicação diferente de como diferenciar do que dar no gratuito e no pago para atrair o lead. Essa explicação dele foi bem simples e ilustrativa.Alex usa a boa e velha estratégia sobre falar sobre a estratégia milionária sem aprofundar em nada. Tudo muito rápido. Neste quesito para quem está começando, vá nos livros do Russell Brunson. Ele aprofunda mais, busque materiais clássicos Hubspot, e muitos vídeos no Youtube sobre funil.Este livro é apenas um apunhado dos clássicos de marketing com desenhinhos. Não tem nenhuma ideia \"uau\" nunca vi antes. Ele vende como o Santo graal, só que é basicamente a estrutura de funil clássica que todos ensinam.Só para constar: o primeiro dele tem sacadas muito mais diferentes e inovadoras. É uma ótima leitura que vale muito a pena.Minha sugestão para este livro: se comprar, bata o olho no índice e vá para as partes que te interessam. Não é um livro que precisa ser lido página página.E quer compreender por que o livro tem uma nota tão alta a ponto de parecer uma seita religiosa? Ele pede para as pessoas virem aqui falar bem. Bem no meio do livro (depois que ele te dou um monte de informação) ele coloca alguns gatilhos emocionais e te pede isso.Aprendi algo com Jim Edwards, um dos maiores copys da atualidade: olhe sempre as notas 2, 3 e 4 da Amazon, elas são as mais importantes.Quem dá 5 são os fanáticos que não vem erros ou defeitos (ou foram comprados com pedidos bonitos), quem dá 1 é a pessoa frustrada com a vida que não teve capacidade de enxergar NADA de bom. Fuja destes 2 grupos de pessoas. De nada, te ensinei a encontrar boas obras na Amazon!",

As someone who struggles to advertise or promote their business, this has been incredibly insightful and valuable.Big lesson: try and fail again and again. You can learn where to start from the lessons of others but no lesson is as valuable as learning from your own mistakes.I also love hearing about his failures. How he was clueless and terrible at tech when he started. About how he worked his ass off and continues to do so, always improving though never being perfect and being ok with that.Hormozi loves to bring value to people - that much is clear.

  "reviewDescription": "Alex's number one skill is the ability to simplify everything. I can appreciate this as an engineer. The only way to get thru school was to learn how to learn and this required breaking things down to simple understandings. It took me 3.5 years to do this in engineering. To have someone break things down in marketing and expedite my learning curve is significantly appreciated.As new business owners, my wife and I have taken advice from Alex's podcasts and YouTube shorts, and have placed ourselves in a very favorable position to be successful. We have been practicing the \"giving\" concept and it is paying off. We are establishing a reputation and have already had people mention they have attempted to rebook with us immediately and can not because it is getting booked up.It is taking me some time to get thru the book because it is written in notes format, as well as thoughts both long and short. With this writing style, Alex packs a huge amount of information to think upon with every set of bullet points or thoughts.The concept of taking that much more time than $100M Offers is apparent. Offers was a really good book, but this one definitely packs way more of a punch. Highly recommend.",

  "reviewDescription": "I like Alex's writing style, and he has helped me a lot in founding a startup between his books and his YouTube channel. I am new to marketing and e-commerce and he saved me alot of time and head scratching than if I hadn't had a resource such as this book to teach me about content, warm/cold outreach, paid ads, etc. I also recommend his first book that focuses on the product itself. The only thing I would change is to clean up the language a bit. It's not overwhelming but an F bomb here and there make me not able to play his content in front of my young son as we don't allow swearing in the household. But I won't deduct a star because the actual value of the book is worth 5 stars. Just a note that maybe the author will consider for broader appeal. But maybe it true that many people resonate with cursing these days and I'm the odd man out. All in all, Nice job Alex!",

I think this could create issues if an entrepreneur works in an industry where they are highly paid consultants and use a strong dr frame. That said, the book is clearly written well and aimed at all levels. So I see the benefit to others.Excellent descriptions as expected from Alex and some brilliant, useful advice.",

  "reviewDescription": "The book is good for beginners in business for the first 50 pages.After it was more informative for myself as It correlates with the stage I’m at in my content creation career (knowing what to do, but getting started).Alex speaks like a bro, so easily relatable and the book is well spaced out , so it appeals to the hyper active mind like myself. Regular looking books can visually get boring for me.All in all, I’d recommend buying this book, If you are looking to gain knowledge on the modern day business models, ex social media etc",

  "reviewDescription": "Juste like his first book Alex delivered SO much value in this book. What I like the most is that it is so practical, you can actually just follow his steps and get to work right away. Alex is also truly true to himself and to us readers. He just says the things as they are without making us think that creating a successful business is something that can be done overnight. It takes some time , consistency and dedication. What he’s teaching is simple but it takes discipline and dedication. I have been in this entrepreneurship journey for quite some time now and I can tell you that Alex sums up many of the important marketing tactics you need to know to make your business profitable. What he teaches can be applied to any business although sometimes i feel it’s a bit more targeted to info products. Thank you Alex for giving us all those strategies. Truly grateful!",
