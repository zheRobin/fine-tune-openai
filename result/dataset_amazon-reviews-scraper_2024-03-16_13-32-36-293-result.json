As a testament to this, I willingly chose to forego the cheaper digital/audible editions, opting instead to invest in this full-price printed copy.That being said, this is absolutely the most subpar print quality I have ever encountered in any book. The images appear to have undergone severe compression, presumably in an attempt to conserve ink. The attached table forces me to strain my eyes, overshadowing its intended impact as a meaningful example. The photo of the hand-written note is rendered practically illegible due to poor lighting, leaving me to wonder if there was truly no feasible way to enhance its clarity even slightly.

{"Title": "The Big Concept. Even Bigger Delivery.", "Description": "$100M Offers is an excellent book in more than one way. First of all, I want to scream from the rooftops how amazing the concept of this book itself is.I\u2019m in the book advertising business. Long ago (read: a few years back), I noticed how great an opportunity creating books was for business owners. You can sell the book, let people get to know you and your offer, and give them an incentive to go back for more.I\u2019m an author myself, and I know firsthand how common readers can turn into great customers. Yet, when I tried to explain my concept, very few entrepreneurs got it. And finding an entrepreneur who not only understood it, but implemented it in the right way, is as hard as trying to find a unicorn.Alex Hormonzi is a unicorn, and then some.He didn\u2019t just write a book to lure readers and turn them into customers. He wrote a book, so they could grow their businesses to even qualify as his prospects! This is my concept taken to another level. And the execution was flawless too.No Weak PointsI couldn\u2019t see any CONS of $100M Offers. This book is just great. Short, to the point, yet incredibly meaty.Like very few books I read, it was written with the specific goal in mind and it sticks to this agenda rigidly. The book also reads very well. It\u2019s written in plain English. It\u2019s extremely quotable. And the how-to in the book is pure gold.PROS$100M Offers has many advantages. I will just highlight several points that caught my attention.1. Amazing Business Book.As I said \u2013 pure gold. This book is packed full with so many business tips. I\u2019m a half-time entrepreneur and my business is miniscule. I\u2019m faraway from making $3M to qualify as Alex\u2019s prospect. Yet, I learned a lot. I\u2019m in a better position to close the gap between where I am now (a way below $100k) and being prospect-worthy for Alex.And that\u2019s the proof of his idea. Alex published a book. A guy in faraway Poland read it, heard about him, loved his content, and got to know him as a person.Now, I have much better chances to ever make $3M. And Alex increased his chances to get a new client in the future. And he made 33 cents (the Kindle royalties) in the process. \ud83d\ude00As a greenhorn, I got the most out of Sections II and III. I got the feeling in which kind of business I am and which type of entrepreneur I am.The most impactful business advice for me? Here:\"No one can serve two masters.(\u2026)\u201d\u201cIf you are under $10M per year, niching down will make you more money.\u201dIntellectually, I\u2019ve known for a long time I need to niche down. I was just too lazy to ever try. I like doing many things.But I\u2019m a way below the $10M cap, and I definitely could\u2019ve used more money. Right here, right now.2. Business Philosophy Close to My Heart.Alex is a way better entrepreneur than me. Yet, the principles he teaches are the principles I live by. I guess this is why this book made so much sense for me.\"Some people get there slowly. But everyone gets there eventually, as long as you don\u2019t give up.\u201dPerseverance is a key to success. And I\u2019m definitely the \u2018getting there slowly\u2019 guy. I need time to process things. I need time to accommodate to change. But I also never give up. I\u2019m much closer to financial independence now than nine years ago when I published my first book.\"Entrepreneurship is about acquiring skills, beliefs, and character traits.\u201dAmen. Most people easily grasp a need for acquiring skills. Much fewer understand a necessity to change one\u2019s mindset. But acquiring character traits?! This is something so \u2018out there\u2019 that people just shrug it off.However, this is how you become an entrepreneur and grow as one. 10 years ago, I was an ordinary employee. I never had led even one person in my life. When I realized I need to own a business to reach a lifestyle I desired, I also realized I\u2019m the worst possible material for entrepreneurship. Thus, I decided to work on myself, on my character, not skills. In several months, I started making money outside of my day job for the first time in my life. In several years, I started my own business. Now, my team consists of seven people working for me regularly and a few contractors.I couldn\u2019t made it if I started from acquiring skills.3. Personal Approach.Alex starts his book from a gut-wrenching personal story. While I never experienced such an enormous pressure like him \u2013 I am way too risk-averse to bet everything I own on my business \u2013 I could easily relate. He won me by this story.\"Entrepreneurship is a crazy rollercoaster. I dipped into my savings to pay my people or business bills all too often. I had business disasters (my blog was hacked; twice) and unexpected business opportunities (people reaching out to me out of the blue to buy my services).\u201dThe author skillfully sprinkled his personal stories throughout the book. They took very little volume of the book, but they are very memorable.I remembered best the one close to the end, when Alex described how he felt, when he finally got over $100,000 in his personal account. Quoting him:\"Tens of millions of dollars in the bank later, it was, and still is, the richest I have ever felt in my life.\u201d4. Money Mindset.Now, there are many experts on business tactics and strategies. There are very few experts on shaping one\u2019s money mindset to earn s*it loads of money.\"Making s*it loads of money breaks people\u2019s minds.\u201dPersonally, it breaks my mind to make more than 98% of my country population. I struggle to grow my business because I have \u2018it all.\u2019 I definitely can rub off some abundance mindset from Alex.He very smartly explained why entrepreneurs should charge so much that it hurts. Thanks to $100M Offers I\u2019m slowly stretching my money mindset, charging 2-6 times more than I had charged.5. Excellent Detailed Advice.Have I mentioned the nitty-gritty advice? Just one example:10x to 1/10th test.\"If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000) what would I provide? If they paid me 1/10th the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that?\u201dWow, talking about stretching your mind! And this is just a single exercise out of dozens instanced in the book.6. Amazing Quotes.Alex definitely has the gift of words. Just a sample of powerful quotes from $100M Offers:\"Humans suffer a lot. So for us entrepreneurs, endless opportunity abounds.\u201dGreat authors have great ability to describe reality. Drop mic. It also gave me a moment of reflection upon the human condition. This is reality. We suffer. We have always suffered, and always will. Like almost everything, it has bad aspects (hurt) and good ones \u2013 like endless opportunities to alleviate our neighbors\u2019 sufferings.\"The person who needs the exchange less always has the upper hand.\u201dThis helped me realize why I\u2019m still in the business. I always have had an upper hand. I do not care for my prospects\u2019 \u2018yes.\u2019 After a few years, I exactly know with whom I want to work. Definitely, I don\u2019t want to work with authors who cannot trust me.\"Scarcity is a function of quantity. Urgency is a function of time.\u201dSo succinct. So aptly said. Two greatest sales functions described in a dozen words.SummaryDo you want to grow your company to $3M-$50M? You will not get a better textbook on that subject than $100M Offers. And you will get it for just 99 cents.This is an absolute no-brainer. It\u2019s also the no-brainer for anyone remotely interested in business in general. You cannot get a better education for a smaller fee than this book.", "AI_Category": "high_value_positive"},
{"Title": "One of the best books I\u2019ve ever read on business, entrepreneurship, sales, etc.", "Description": "I found out about Alex Hormozi about a year ago. I decided to buy all of his books. However, this review is specifically on the $100 million offers.This is one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read. It is formatted, so neatly, with clear and concise information. There are so many gems in here on marketing, psychology, business, entrepreneurship, sales, and of course offers. This is so well-written, relatable, and really makes you stay accountable in your business. I have had multiple business coaches in the past tell me that I need to raise my prices. I was hesitant at first, because I didn\u2019t want to feel like I was charging way too much for something, but Alex talks about how by raising your prices to a much higher level, consequently you will be able to provide even more value for your clients/customers. Your program or product will be of even higher value. For example, I sell personal training mastery programs. Just for the sake of math, let\u2019s say I charged $500 for a program. If I wanted to make $10,000 in a month, I have to sell 20 programs and have 20 clients. I also need to keep track of, organize, and assist 20 people. If I charged $5000, I would need two clients. I would spend all my time and attention on those two, giving them extraordinary support, motivation, guaranteed results, etc. I was very hesitant to raise prices, but when you realize you can absolutely do it in a good way, morally and ethically, whilst actually giving much more value, attention, reassurance, and results to a customer, it\u2019s a no-brainer.

I would recommend it for people starting out with business books because he explains important concepts in a way that everybody can grasp, and there are - as with any business book - new ways of looking at things and novel tips.

{"Title": "excellent for the most part", "Description": "This feels like a great breakdown of how to create a compelling product that people will want to buy. It's highly logical and clear in it's delivery.  The claims made and the advice given often set off lightbulbs in my head - things that seem self evident in retrospect but I hadn't considered.  It's also fairly brief and to the point; as simple as possible but no simpler, as Einstein once remarked.However there are a couple of points that prevent me from giving it 5 stars ( I would give 4.5 if I could).Firstly, although it sets out to be a general purpose book that applies to any product and any market, it often in practice applies more to the kinds of business that the author has experience in (b2b consulting). There are various points where it felt like the recommendations wouldn't apply so much to e.g. ecommerce or the sale of physical goods. Having said that, there's plenty of nuggets in the book that would crossover to any business.My second gripe is with his value equation. Simply put, it's nonsense. He claims that value (ie the value that an offer provides to a customer) is expressed by:  (dream outcome * probability of achieving the outcome) /  ( time delay * costs and inconveniences involved for customer in achieving the outcome).The problem is that this implies that if the dream outcome is achieved instantly, then it has infinite value to the customer. This is ludicrous. If i sell you a car worth 10k, delivering it instantly doesn't magically make it worth infinity dollars. Nor does it make sense to say that it's worth infinity dollars if the customer doesn't have to expend any effort or expense (apart from the ticket price) in acquiring the car.  What's truly bizarre is that the author specifically says that he designed the equation DELIBERATELY so as to imply these infinite value scenarios. He doesn't explain why he did, only that he did.  So he's apparently proud of having produced an absurdity. If I'm missing something here, so be it, but it would have been nice if he had addressed this concern. I feel like this concept of a value equation has legs, but the 'time delay' should be a power law, similar to discounted cash flow, and the cost-effort part should just be subtracted from the value/probability/time part rather than a denominator.All in all though, I would highly recommend this book.", "AI_Category": "high_value_negative"},
