I ordered the book pretty quickly when I saw how many 5 star reviews it received. After reading it I don't really understand why it is so highly rated. If you are reading this book, I assume you are already in the business sphere. Nothing you read here is original or insightful. Its everything that has been said and stated before. There are better books out there on sales strategy and online market strategy. Just listening to some Gary Vee videos will tell you everything you need to know about creating and posting content much better than this book.  The only good thing about this book is the simplicity with which it is laid out. Its written in a \"business for dummies\" format which makes it digestible but it doesn't really have all that much to say. I wouldn't recommend it, its pretty vapid", "AI_Category": " low_value"},

To have someone break things down in marketing and expedite my learning curve is significantly appreciated.As new business owners, my wife and I have taken advice from Alex's podcasts and YouTube shorts, and have placed ourselves in a very favorable position to be successful. We have been practicing the \"giving\" concept and it is paying off. We are establishing a reputation and have already had people mention they have attempted to rebook with us immediately and can not because it is getting booked up.It is taking me some time to get thru the book because it is written in notes format, as well as thoughts both long and short. With this writing style, Alex packs a huge amount of information to think upon with every set of bullet points or thoughts.The concept of taking that much more time than $100M Offers is apparent. Offers was a really good book, but this one definitely packs way more of a punch. Highly recommend.", "AI_Category": " high_value_positive"},

I am new to marketing and e-commerce and he saved me alot of time and head scratching than if I hadn't had a resource such as this book to teach me about content, warm/cold outreach, paid ads, etc. I also recommend his first book that focuses on the product itself. The only thing I would change is to clean up the language a bit. It's not overwhelming but an F bomb here and there make me not able to play his content in front of my young son as we don't allow swearing in the household. But I won't deduct a star because the actual value of the book is worth 5 stars. Just a note that maybe the author will consider for broader appeal.
